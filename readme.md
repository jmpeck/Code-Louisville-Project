## FEWD Project by John Peck

I created this website for a young realtor in Nashville. New to the industry, she wanted
a site that combined elements typical of her competitors with those that highlighted her
brand as "Nashville's Realtor." I combined her desired features into a responsive layout.
I used jQuery to make her navigation bar collapsible and to create a lightbox environment
for viewing larger photos of her properties when the thumbnails are clicked.

To view this webpage, simply click on the index.html file.
